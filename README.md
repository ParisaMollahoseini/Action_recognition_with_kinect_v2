# Action_recognition_with_kinectv2
Action recognition on kinect Xbox one

### ✅ Explanation
----

In this project we want to build a model to recognize 5 human actions infront of kinect device. To achieve this, first we chose a dataset named KARD, second processed it to make it useable in target model, and finally train the model.


### ✅  How to run
----

Follow these steps to read folders and run the codes:
➙ First open the data folder and follow the instructions explained on its readme file
➙ Open create_model folder and follow the instructions to train and test model on data processed before
➙ Finally you can open test_on_kinect folder to test your saved model on real data. 😊
