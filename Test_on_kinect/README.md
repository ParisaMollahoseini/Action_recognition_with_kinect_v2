# Test model on Kinect device
## In progress

### âœ… Explanation
In this code we want to test our model on kinect device.<br>
Different parts of this code are listed bellow:
- Install the required packages.
- Load trained model.
- Create the cell with BodyGameRuntime class for recieving kinect frames.
- Create functions for conversion of body skeleton to image and prediction.

### âœ… How to run

Connect the kinect device to your PC and just change the directories to your directories and run the cells one by one.
Remeber to stand at least 2 meters far from kinect. Because kinect should recognize your whole body to get your skeleton body points and prediction result of sending data to the model.


ðŸ“Œ After running the code with BodyGameRuntime class, you have 2 seconds to be in right distance from kinect otherwise you get error. Then you can run its following cell and again run the previous cell again.

ðŸ“Œ <b> In future versions of this code we will handle this error. </b>
